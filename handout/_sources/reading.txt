Credit to Jason Kirtland for assembling this list.

* Celko, J. (2010) *SQL for Smarties.*  Morgan Kaufmann.

  A sprawling book with many gems of SQL knowledge.  This book is now up to its fourth edition
  and seems to have been modified quite a bit.

* The SQL92 Standard

  Available as a .txt file from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL-92

* Harrington, J. (2003) *SQL Clearly Explained.*  Morgan Kaufmann.

  Exactly what the title claims.

* Schmidt, B. (1999) *Data Modeling for Information Professionals.*  Prentice Hall PTR.

  A fantastic resource for anyone in any profession who needs to think
  critically about information and its structure.

* Nock, C. (2004) *Data Access Patterns.*  Addison-Wesley.

* Fowler, M. (2002) *Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture.*  Addison-Wesley Professional.

* Schmidt, D., et al. (2000) *Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture volume 2,
  Patterns for Concurrent and Networked Objects.*  Wiley.

  These three delve into the the mechanics of data access and strategies for concurrency.
  *Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture* was a primary inspiration
  for the creation of SQLAlchemy itself.  The blog post *Patterns Implemented by SQLAlchemy* (http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2012/02/07/patterns-implemented-by-sqlalchemy) details this.

* Hay, D. (1996) *Data Model Patterns, Conventions of Thought.*  Dorset House.

* Fowler, M. (1997) *Analysis Patterns.*  Addison-Wesley.

  Both books provide good schema advice and domain knowledge for
  classic topics such as accounting.
