Purpose of this Document
========================

Students attending the *Introduction to SQLAlchemy* tutorial
should receive a copy of this document prior to attending the class,
and hopefully will be able to download the entire student handout package.

At the very least, students should read through the
:doc:`relational` section of this document, which introduces/reviews
basic relational database and transactional concepts; this section
is essentially prerequisite material to the tutorial itself.  As many/most
students will be familiar with a large portion of this material, making
it available ahead of time will hopefully allow those who are less
familiar to catch up, while not spending too much time in the class
itself with what may be review material for many.

A second task that would be extremely helpful would be for students
to install and test the slide runner environment and application; the
:doc:`setup` section describes these steps in detail, and includes
getting students familiar with Python virtual environments if not already,
getting the latest version of SQLAlchemy installed into the local
(non-system-wide) environment, and ensuring that the tutorial slides
can be run successfully.  In the actual class, we'll spend a lot of time
stepping through these slides, and students can step through the same
slides locally on their machines as well as attempt other experiments
and exercises within the environment.

Two other sections, :doc:`glossary` and :doc:`reading`, represent more
detailed paths for learning.  The glossary is broken into two sections:
:ref:`glossary_relational` and :ref:`glossary_sqlalchemy`.  It's a good
idea for students to run through the relational section here; the SQLAlchemy
section on the other hand will be more useful after the tutorial is complete,
as a place to review some of the key concepts covered in the material.

Presenters / Credits
=====================

Michael Bayer (http://techspot.zzzeek.org) is a NYC-based software contractor with a decade of
experience dealing with relational databases of all shapes and sizes.
After writing many homegrown database abstraction layers in such
languages as C, Java and Perl, and finally after several years of
practice working with a huge multi-server Oracle system for Major
League Baseball, he wrote SQLAlchemy as the 'ultimate toolset' for
generating SQL and dealing with databases overall. The goal is to
contribute towards a world-class one-of-a-kind toolset for Python,
helping to make Python the universally popular programming platform it
deserves to be.

Parts of this handout, as well as the core of the "Slide Presenter"
tool, were written by Jason Kirtland (http://discorporate.us/jek/)
who has been a key contributor to the SQLAlchemy project for many years.

Big thanks to Ben Trofatter for help editing / proofreading this document.
